# My Second Project For School
My second project for school. It consists of a 3D renderer and soon to be basic physics.

# Basic Information
I will soon be uploading a more complete and cleaned up version of the renderer which has some optomizaitons. I will also be working on a physics engine so the player can collide with the static meshes.

# Planned Features

- A 3D renderer (needs optomization)
- A basic physics engine (work in progress, currently working on the collision detection)
- Basic maps and game mechanics (haven't started on)
- Data saving and loading for the levels (haven't started on)

# Goals

- At least 15 fps
- Dealine; 2 weeks or so
- A fair bit of polish
- Nice and tidy readable code
